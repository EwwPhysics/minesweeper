# Minesweeper

The goal of minesweeper is to determine the location of several mines placed on a 14x14 board. You can win by uncovering all squares which do not contain a mine. Uncovering a mine will make you lose.

To run this project:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sashakmurray/minesweeper.git
$ cd minesweeper
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 -m src
```

Some of these commands may vary based on your operating system.
